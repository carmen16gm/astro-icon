Finally, `astro-icon@1.0.0` has arrived! This release provides a more flexible and reliable method of icon management, removes a number of redundant APIs, and now relies on Astro's official integration API.

Please see the [Upgade to `astro-icon` v1](https://www.astroicon.dev/guides/upgrade/v1/) guide for specific migration steps and [the package README](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon/tree/main/packages/core#astro-icon) for more information.
